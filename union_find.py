# Disjoint-set data structure, also known as union-find data structure.
# Keeps track of `n` disjoint sets and allows merging any two sets by refering
# to any one of their respective elements.
# The use of path compression and union-by rank gives a worst case runtime of Î±(n)
# for both the `find` and `union` methods, where Î± is the inverse Ackermann function.
